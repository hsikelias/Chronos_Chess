# CHRONOS-CHESS

Chrono Chess is made to record your "over the board" chess games. It records the moves you played, allows you to add your own time control. It even **eliminates the use of a chess clock** by tracking the time along with moves played by the player. The development phase of Chrono Chess will begin soon!
