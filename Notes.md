# THE PLAN

- The first thing to start with is the __board detection__. Try out differnet opencv techniques like **edge detection**, **Hough transforms**, and **X-corner identifiction**. But these are not advanced, need much modern machine learning stuff(need to do more research).


## CLASSIC CV METHODS:

1. Goal: Identify the four precise pixel coordinates of the chessboard's corners by identifying its outer boundary
2.
